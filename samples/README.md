# Alfar samples
These samples are meant to show how to go from showing a 2D texture in OpenGL, to a 3D texture,
like one would use in volume rendering. The goal is that one should be able to diff one sample with the next
and see only changes that are relevant to this step, such as going from 2D to 3D.

The samples start with a static 2D texture and each next sample introduces a small change, ending up
with a 3D texture being displayed using volume rendering techniques.

The samples do not contain any controls to keep them as simple as possible.
